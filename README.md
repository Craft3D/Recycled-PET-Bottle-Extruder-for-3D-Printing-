# Recycled-PET-Bottle-Extruder-for-3D-Printing-

Based on the original schematics by Precious Plastics, the aim of this project is to produce 3D printing filament from recycled PET bottles by building a version of the plastic extruder in addition with a new design for a filament winder.

For a low cost assembly, the extruder is operated with PID Temperature Controllers while the filament winder consists of two stepper motors controlled by pololu A4988 drivers along with Ramps 1.4 and ArduinoMega2560 Boards.
